This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Introduction

This is a demo of uploading a file via GraphQL using:

- [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client)
- [Apollo Server Micro](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/main/packages/apollo-server-micro) - setup in the `pages/api` folder.

Next.js has an [example of an Apollo Server and Client setup with Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/api-routes-apollo-server-and-client).

The server is not configured to do anything with the file after it has been transferred.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
